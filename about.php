                     <p>Trade-in values may vary, and are based on the condition and model of your trade-in device. You must be at least 18. Offer may not be available in all stores and not all devices are eligible for credit. Apple or its trade-in partners reserve the right to refuse or limit any trade-in transaction for any reason. In-store trade-in requires presentation of a valid photo ID. Sales tax may be assessed on full value of new iPhone. Value of your current device may be applied towards purchase of a new Apple device.

The display has rounded corners that follow a beautiful curved design, and these corners are within a standard rectangle. When measured as a standard rectangular shape, the screen is 13.72 centimeters / 5.42 inches (iPhone 13 mini), 15.04 centimeters / 6.06 inches (iPhone 13, iPhone 14), 15.54 centimeters / 6.12 inches (iPhone 14 Pro), 16.97 centimeters / 6.68 inches (iPhone 14 Plus), or 16.99 centimeters / 6.69 inches (iPhone 14 Pro Max) diagonally. Actual viewable area is less.
Available space is less and varies due to many factors. A standard configuration uses approximately 12GB to 17GB of space, including iOS 15 with its latest features and Apple apps that can be deleted. Apple apps that can be deleted use about 4.5GB of space, and you can download them back from the App Store. Storage capacity is subject to change based on software version, settings and iPhone model.
All battery claims depend on network configuration and many other factors; actual results will vary. Battery has limited recharge cycles and may eventually need to be replaced. Battery life and charge cycles vary by use and settings. See apple.com/in/batteries and apple.com/in/iphone/battery.html for more information.
Data plan is required. 5G, Gigabit LTE, 4G LTE Advanced, 4G LTE, VoLTE and Wi-Fi calling are available in selected markets and through selected carriers. Speeds vary based on site conditions and carrier. For details on 5G and LTE support, contact your carrier and see apple.com/in/iphone/cellular.
